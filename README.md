# KeDA TECH TEST

## Overview
This repository contains two main projects: a React Landing Page for an ERP System and a set of coding challenges grouped under Test Code. These projects demonstrate my skills in frontend development, specifically with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS, as well as algorithmic problem-solving.

#### 1. React Landing Page for ERP System

Project Name: [`react-erp-kedatech`](/react-erp-kedatech/)

###### Description:

The ERP system landing page is designed with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS to showcase my ability to create a modern, responsive interface. It incorporates several advanced design principles, such as glassmorphism, to deliver a sleek and visually engaging user experience.

###### Key Features:

- Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Tailwind CSS: Utilizes a utility-first CSS framework for fast and efficient styling.
- Glassmorphism Effect: Integrates the trending glass-like design to enhance the visual appeal.
- Component-based Architecture: Implements reusable components to ensure clean and scalable code.

###### Technologies Used:

- ReactJS
- React Router DOM
- Tailwind CSS

###### Project Structure:

The project is structured around the best practices for React development, including clear separation of concerns and reusable UI components.

### 2. Test Code

Project Name: [`test_code`](/test_code/)

###### Description:

This project contains solutions to several coding challenges, implemented with a focus on clean code, efficiency, and thorough unit testing. Each function solves a specific problem, and is accompanied by tests that verify its correctness across various input cases.

###### Included Challenges:

- Sorting an Array in Descending Order
  A function that manually sorts an array without using JavaScript's built-in sorting functions.

- Maximum Subarray Sum
  A function that calculates the maximum sum of subarrays with a given length using the sliding window technique.

- Sum of Even Numbers in a Nested Object
  A recursive function that sums all even numbers within a deeply nested object.

###### Unit Tests:

Each function is covered by unit tests that verify the implementation's correctness across various input scenarios and edge cases.

## How to Run the Projects

#### 1. React Landing Page for ERP System

To run the react-landing-page-erp project locally:

###### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anggarobo/kedatech-test.git
cd kedatech-test/react-erp-kedatech
```

###### 2. Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

###### 3. Run the Development Server:

```bash
npm run start
```

###### 4. View in Browser:

The application will run at http://localhost:3000 by default.

#### 2. Test Code

The test-code project is a collection of JavaScript files with algorithmic solutions. To run the tests:

###### 1. Navigate to the Folder:

```bash
cd kedatech-test/test_code
```

###### 2. Run Tests:

Since the unit tests are implemented using console.assert, simply run the script files in Node.js:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Each script will execute and display the test results in the console.

## Conclusion

This repository showcases my expertise in both frontend development with React and problem-solving using JavaScript. The projects cover key areas such as responsive design, modern web UI trends, and algorithmic efficiency. I hope this submission demonstrates my skills and commitment to delivering clean, efficient, and scalable solutions.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out with any questions or feedback!
